How does one go about using it?
when opening the app, you setup the quote theme then you setup the alarm time. Easy peasy lemon squeezy

Project is: _in progress_ i want to inplement an AI that reads your facial expression and mood and provide you with the quote you need without having to change the theme everytime.
## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- would like the popup screen to appear as soon as the alarm goes off instead of having to click a button
- Stylisticly , i think KivyMD is very limitting . So i would like to improve on the front end of the app
To do:
-learn AI
